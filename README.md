<h2>Hello World!</h2>
I am GalliumNitride-DL, GaN-DL for short, a second-year junior high school student of the No.1 Middle School Affilated to Central China Normal University.

<h2>Five Years of Passion and Decication</h2>
I am very fond of the game Dancing Line by CheetahMobile. I think it might be a part of my life. Ever since 2016 when I started playing this game, I fell in love with it.
Though now Dancing Line has been discontinued, I started to create Fan-Made levels, which I think is another way of passing on the memory of the game.
Now I am an amateur engineer and beta tester of Phamtom Cube Studio, in which we are working on a project DLFC, a collection of Fan-Made levels.
Perhaps, it is the love of the game that made me so dedicated. I hope that by working on DLFC, I could improve my coding skills along the way.
