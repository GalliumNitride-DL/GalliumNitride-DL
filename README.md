<h2>Hello World!</h2>
I am GalliumNitride-DL, GaN - DL for short, a second-year senior high school student of the No.1 Middle School Affilated to Central China Normal University.

<h2>Five Years of Passion and Dedication</h2>
I am very fond of the game Dancing Line by CheetahMobile. I think it might be a part of my life. Ever since 2016 when I started playing this game, I fell in love with it.<br/>
Though now Dancing Line has been discontinued, I started to create Fan-Made levels, which I think is another way of passing on the memory of the game.<br/>
Now I am an amateur engineer and beta tester of Phamtom Cube Studio, in which we are working on a project DLFC, a collection of Fan-Made levels.<br/>
Perhaps, it is the love of the game that made me so dedicated. I hope that by working on DLFC, I could improve my coding skills along the way.<br/>

<h2>Hello World!</h2>
我是GalliumNitride-DL，或者GaN - DL，华中师范大学第一附属中学高二年级在读学生。会一点点Unity（与之配套的C#）和cpp。

<h2>热爱《跳舞的线》</h2>
自2016年起我开始玩《跳舞的线》。虽然现在这一款游戏已经停更，但是《跳舞的线》饭圈文化得以保留与延续。自2020我开始从事跳舞的线饭制制作，现为幻影立方工作室（Phantom Cube Studio, PCS）新人工程师兼客服。我们正在制作《跳舞的线饭制合集》（Dancing Line Fan-made Collection, DLFC），希望能够在发布后获得大家的喜欢。<br/>
我将一直热爱《跳舞的线》，正是这份热爱让我如此执着。<br/>
我的程序水平、Unity引擎操作水平都不高，我希望能够通过《跳舞的线》饭制制作来提升我的水平。<br/>
